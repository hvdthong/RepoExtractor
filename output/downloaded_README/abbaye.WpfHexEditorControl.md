## What is TBL (custom character table)
The TBL are small plaintext .tbl files that link every hexadecimal value with a character, which proves most useful when reading and changing text data. Wpf HexEditor support .tbl and you can define your custom character table as you want.

Unicode TBL are supported. For use put value at the right of equal (=) like this (0401=塞西尔) or (42=Д) in you plaintext .tbl file.
