# Myrtille
Myrtille provides a simple and fast access to remote desktops and applications through a web browser, without any plugin, extension or configuration.

Technically, Myrtille is an HTTP(S) to RDP gateway.

## How does it work?
It works by forwarding the user inputs (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen) from a web browser to an HTTP(S) gateway, then up to an RDP client which maintains a session with an RDP server.

The display resulting, or not, of such actions is streamed back to the browser, from the rdp client and through the gateway.

The implementation is quite straightforward in order to maintain the best speed and stability as possible. Some optimizations, such as inputs buffering and display quality tweaking, help to mitigate with latency and bandwidth issues.

More information in the DOCUMENTATION.md file.

## Features
- HTTP(S) to RDP gateway
- Multifactor Authentication
- Active Directory integration
- Start remote application from URL
- File transfer (local and roaming accounts)
- PDF Virtual Printer
- HTML4 and HTML5 support
- Responsive design
- Remote clipboard support
- PNG, JPEG and WEBP compression
- Realtime connection information
- On-screen/console/logfile debug information
- fully parameterizable

## Requirements
- Browser: any HTML4 or HTML5 browser (starting from IE6!). No extension or administrative rights required.
- Gateway (myrtille): IIS 7 or greater (preferably IIS 8+ with websocket protocol enabled) and .NET 4.5+
- RDP server: any RDP enabled computer (preferably Windows Server but can also be Windows XP, 7, 8, 10)

## Resources
Myrtille does support multiple connections/tabs in cookieless session mode. From version 1.9.0, this mode is disabled by default (OWASP recommendation) but can still be enabled, if required (into web.config, carefully read comments there).

There is no limitation about the maximal number of concurrent users beside what the rdp server(s) can handle (number of CALs, CPU, RAM?).

Regarding the gateway, a simple dual core CPU with 4GB RAM can handle up to 50 simultaneous sessions (about 50MB RAM by rdp client process).

Each session uses about 20KB/sec bandwidth with the browser.

## Build
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. See DOCUMENTATION.md.

## Installation
All releases here: https://github.com/cedrozor/myrtille/releases

See DOCUMENTATION.md for more details.

## Usage
Once Myrtille is installed on your server, you can use it at http://myserver/myrtille. Set the rdp server address, user domain (if any), name and password then click "Connect!" to log in. "Disconnect" to log out.

Multifactor Authentication and Active Directory integration (Enterprise Mode) are disabled by default. Please read documentation for activation of these features.

You can also connect a remote desktop and **start a program automatically from an url** (see DOCUMENTATION.md). From version 1.5.0, Myrtille does support encrypted credentials (aka "password 51" into .rdp files) so the urls can be distributed to third parties without compromising on security.

The installer creates a self-signed certificate for https://myserver/myrtille. Like for all self-signed certificates, you will have to add a security exception into your browser (just ignore the warning message and proceed to the website). **Usage of https is recommended** to secure your remote connection.
Of course, you can avoid that by installing a certificate provided by a trusted Certification Authority (see DOCUMENTATION.md).

If you want connection information, you can enable stat (displayed on screen or browser console). If you want debug information, you can enable debug (logs are saved under the Myrtille "log" folder). *Hidden from version 1.5.0 (can be enabled into default.css)*.

You can also choose the rendering mode, HTML4 or HTML5 (HTML4 may be useful, for example, if websockets are blocked by a proxy or firewall). *Hidden (autodetected) from version 1.5.0 (can be enabled into default.css)*.

On touchscreen devices, you can pop the device keyboard with the "Keyboard" button. Then enter some text and click "Send". This can be used, for example, to paste the local clipboard content and send it to the server (then it be copied from there, within the remote session).
Alternatively, you can run **osk.exe** (the Windows on screen keyboard, located into %SystemRoot%\System32) within the remote session. It can even be run automatically on session start (https://www.cybernetman.com/kb/index.cfm/fuseaction/home.viewArticles/articleId/197).

The remote clipboard content can also be retrieved locally with the "Clipboard" button (text format only).

You can upload/download file(s) to/from the user documents folder with the "Files" button. Note that it requires the rdp server to be localhost (same machine as the http server) or a domain to be specified.

You can print any document on a local or network printer by using the "Myrtille PDF" (redirected) virtual printer. Simply use the print feature of your application, then open/print the downloaded pdf.
