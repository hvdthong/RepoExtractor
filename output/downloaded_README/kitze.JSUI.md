## Plugins

- Plugins have the ability to install new dependencies, remove dependencies, modify scripts, remove and add new files to a project
- Right now the following plugins are available: - **Storybook**: Installs storybook and adds the needed files to the project - **Plop**: Adds the `plop` generator to the project. It also adds a default `plop-templates` folder, a `plopfile.js`. - **Add .env**: Adds an `.env` file to the project. Soon this file will be editable through UI. - **Rewire**: Installs `react-app-rewired` and adds a default `config-overrides.js` file

> Note: plugins will be separated from the repo soon so anyone can publish their own plugin

## Generate files

- Automatically detect a `plopfile.js` and quickly generate files from existing templates.
- If `plopfile.js` is not present or you are not familiar with [plop](https://github.com/amwmedia/plop) run the `Plop` plugin and it will generate the needed files for you
